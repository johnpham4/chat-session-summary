{"role": "assistant", "content": "I understand you're asking about a project, but I need more details. Could you clarify: What type of project (work, school, personal)? What is the project about? What specific aspect needs help?"}

{"role": "user", "content": "I'm building a web application for task management"}
{"role": "assistant", "content": "Great! Now I understand. You're building a task management web app. To help you better, could you tell me: What technology stack are you using (React, Vue, Angular, etc.)? What specific features do you want to implement? Are you facing any particular challenges? What's your experience level with web development?"}
{"role": "user", "content": "Using React and Node.js. Need help with the database design"}
{"role": "assistant", "content": "Perfect! For a task management app with React and Node.js, here's a recommended database design: USERS table: id, email, password_hash, name, created_at. PROJECTS table: id, name, description, owner_id (FK to users), created_at. TASKS table: id, title, description, status, priority, project_id (FK to projects), assigned_to (FK to users), due_date, created_at, updated_at. COMMENTS table: id, task_id (FK to tasks), user_id (FK to users), content, created_at. Would you like more details on relationships, indexing, or API design?"}
{"role": "user", "content": "What about it?"}
{"role": "assistant", "content": "Could you be more specific about what aspect you're asking about? Are you asking about: The database schema I just suggested? Implementation details for a specific table? How to handle relationships between tables? Performance optimization? Something else?"}
{"role": "user", "content": "The authentication part, how should I handle that?"}
{"role": "assistant", "content": "For authentication in your React + Node.js app, I recommend: BACKEND (Node.js): Use JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for authentication. Libraries: bcrypt for password hashing, jsonwebtoken for JWT creation. Store: User credentials in database with hashed passwords. FLOW: 1. User registers → hash password with bcrypt → save to DB. 2. User logs in → verify credentials → generate JWT token. 3. Send JWT to client → store in httpOnly cookie or localStorage. 4. Client sends JWT in Authorization header for protected routes. 5. Backend validates JWT on each request. SECURITY: Use httpOnly cookies to prevent XSS. Add refresh tokens for long sessions. Set token expiration (15min access, 7day refresh). Use HTTPS in production. Would you like code examples for the implementation?"}
